%: Intro sheet to the hackspace
\machinePage{Bristol Hackspace}{NoMandatory}{
Observe all safety instructions. Induction or Instructions are required for some of the machines. Ask someone for help, consult the wiki or message the forum when in doubt.

Ask for instructions if you are unfamiliar on how to use a tool. This is to protect you and to protect the tool. This is a shared space -- consider others around you before using a machine; and be aware of others working nearby.  \textbf{Leave the space cleaner than you found it.}

Make sure you know where the \textbf{emergency stops and fire extinguishers} are. In case of "call 999"-type emergencies, make sure there is someone at the door to let paramedics in. If you have to stay with the wounded, jam the doors open. Bring your key(card)s with you if you have to let emergency personnel in.
}{
\action{58}{Wear protective clothing}{Wear tight fitting clothing, keep long hair tied up, no jewellery or anything else that can be caught by a machine. Consider that others may be working at the space -- and you may be in close range of their machines too.

%Be careful with gloves -- they can be caught in the machine and when made of a sturdy material, help rip your finger off. Observe the `no gloves' signs.
}
\action{56}{Wear appropriate footwear}{No sandals or similar in the wood or metal shop.}
\action{64}{Wear a mask when needed}{Especially when cutting materials such as MDF}
\action{52}{Eye protection recommended}{Also consider that hard-metal cutters and ceramics can suddenly shatter.}
\action{57}{Protective gloves recommended}{But also: be careful with gloves -- they can be caught in the machine and when made of a sturdy material, help rip your finger off. }
\action{51}{Ear protection recommended}{}
}{If something breaks or is amiss -- it is \textbf{your} responsibility to report it.  If you find something broken -- report it before using/repairing the machine.
